# **Integrating GitOps and Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and ArgoCD**

<br />
This solution architecture aims to bridge the gap between **GitOps-based deployments and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** by incorporating Terraform for handling **database schema migrations** and managing cloud resources effectively. Since microservices often rely on databases to function properly, it is crucial to ensure that the database layer is provisioned and updated correctly before the application deployment begins. Using a combination of **Terraform, GitLab, Vault, and ArgoCD**, we can streamline the process while enforcing security best practices.

### **Why Use Terraform for Infrastructure and Database Management?**

Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) has become the backbone of modern cloud deployment strategies, offering automation, consistency, and version control. Terraform allows us to define infrastructure declaratively, reducing manual intervention and potential human errors. For our use case, Terraform plays a vital role in:
<br />


- Storing and managing **SQL migration scripts** within a GitLab repository, enabling version-controlled database updates.
- Automating the creation and configuration of **database schemas, users, and role-based access controls**, ensuring that applications have the correct permissions.
- Integrating with **HashiCorp Vault** to securely store and retrieve **database credentials**, reducing exposure and enhancing security.
- Committing necessary infrastructure configurations, such as **Helm values and Kustomize overlays**, into a Git repository where ArgoCD can monitor changes and automatically synchronize environments.
<br />
With this approach, we ensure that database migrations and infrastructure provisioning are tightly coupled with the application deployment process, reducing inconsistencies and deployment failures.
<br />

## **CI/CD Pipeline with GitLab and Tekton: Automating Deployments from Code to Production**

<br />
Every time a **developer pushes code to GitLab** or submits a **merge request**, the pipeline is automatically triggered, ensuring that all infrastructure and application changes are validated before being deployed.
<br />
#### **Pipeline Stages:**
<br />

 **1. Lint & Validate:** The pipeline runs static code analysis, Terraform validation, and schema checks to enforce best practices before execution.

 **2. Build & Push Container:** Tekton builds a container image for the microservice and pushes it to a container registry, ensuring that the latest version is ready for deployment.

 **3. Database Migration Execution:** The pipeline retrieves the database credentials securely from Vault and executes SQL migration scripts using **Liquibase**, ensuring that the database schema is up to date before deploying the application.

 **4. Terraform Apply:** Terraform applies any required infrastructure updates, keeping the cloud environment consistent with the defined state. If Terraform detects configuration changes, it automatically opens a pull request (PR) for review, ensuring that changes are tracked and approved before being applied.
<br />

By automating these processes, we significantly reduce the risk of deployment failures caused by manual errors or misconfigurations.
<br />
### **Ensuring Stability with Automated Testing and Observability**
<br />
Once the application is deployed, it is critical to validate its functionality and monitor its performance. Our solution incorporates several strategies to achieve this:

- **Automated Health Checks & Integration Tests:** After deployment, **ArgoCD** runs a suite of sync hooks health checks and integration tests to confirm that the application is functioning as expected.
- **Comprehensive Monitoring & Logging:** Tools like **Prometheus and Grafana** provide real-time visibility into application performance, while OpenShift’s built-in logging capabilities help troubleshoot issues quickly.
- **Instant Rollbacks:** If a deployment issue arises, ArgoCD enables teams to **revert to the previous stable Git commit**, ensuring minimal downtime and a quick recovery process.

<br />

This approach offers several benefits:

✅ **Automated, version-controlled infrastructure provisioning** eliminates manual setup errors.  
✅ **Secure database migrations** ensure consistency and data integrity.  
✅ **Seamless, rollback-ready microservices deployments** improve resilience.  
✅ **Enhanced observability and security** help teams monitor and manage applications effectively.
